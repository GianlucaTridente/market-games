[MARKET GAMES](https://react-44970.web.app/)

https://react-44970.web.app/

## Description

This proyect is about a fictional e-commerce directed to people who like video games where you can buy a game, this website can be about anything but I decided to choose video games to topic because I have liked playing video games for a long time.

## How to use this repository to see the website in your browser

- You must have node.js to run it.
- Use the terminal to write the next item.
- ### `npm start`
- Check if you are in the same fordel.
- Or you just can use the firebase link https://react-44970.web.app/

## Libraries that I use to do this page

- ## Material UI -v5.10.10

  I decided to use MUI because I did a proyect with Boostrap but in this case I wanted to try something a little different and I liked the result.

- ## Firebase -v9.14.0

  I use it to obtain data (the products) from a database and save the data that the buyer sends me (order id). It is a good way to have a little more contact with "backend".

- ## SweetAlert2 -v11.6.14

  Just to donÂ´t use the default alert.

- ## React Router -v6.4.3
  The best way to have a clean and organized navigation path.
